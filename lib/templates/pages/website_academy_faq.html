                        <h3>Can I really switch power companies and save money?</h3>
                        <span>It depends. The deregulated market changes frequently. As many as 16 states have deregulated the energy industry over the past 10 years, including Texas, New York, Pennsylvania, Massachusetts, Illinois, Connecticut, New Jersey, Maryland, Maine, Oregon, District of Columbia, Delaware, Michigan, Rhode Island, and others. In those states that are deregulated, many people finally have the freedom to choose their supplier and the opportunity to lower their electricity bills! We serve these states and offer incredible deals to our customers.
    Stay tuned…we’ll offer more options for more markets soon.
