                <p>Once you’ve entered your zip code, we’ll present all of the plans available in your area. Keep in mind that we vet all of the plans we offer so you don’t have to worry about falling prey to teaser rates or hidden fees.</p>

                <ul>
                    <li>
                        <strong>Best Plan:</strong> the plan with the lowest fixed rate.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <strong>Best Short Term:</strong> the cheapest rate for a shorter term plan.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <strong>Most Popular:</strong> the plan that many of your neighbors have chosen.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <strong>Best Green:</strong> the plan that offers as much green, or renewable energy resources in your area at the best price.
                    </li>
                </ul>
                <p>The choices don’t end there. You can also sort plans using filters including plan term and supplier ratings. Click on the Details button on any plan, you’ll get even more information. </p>
