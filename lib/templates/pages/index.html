        <h2>Introduction</h2>
        <p><strong>Choose UX</strong> is the living design framework for Choose Energy, versioned in <a href="https://github.com/chooseenergy/ChooseUX">GitHub</a> and hosted on <a href="https://chooseenergy.github.io/ChooseUX">GitHub Pages</a>. <code>ChooseUX/master</code> should be considered the canonical branch.

        <p>Designs and interactions in <strong>Choose UX</strong> are not always meant for copy and paste implementation into other products. They are meant to be a representation of what the resultant interface should look like or how it should function.</p>

        <h2>Philosophy</h2>
    </div>
    <div class="cg-1of4">
        <h3>Comforting</h3>
        <ul>
            <li><p>Switching energy providers is a confusing and scary process for for many people. Our goal should be to demystify in a comforting manner.</p></li>
            <li><p>Providing a human face and emphasizing the human side of energy use allows people to feel better connected to the unfamiliar experience of switching energy providers.</p></li>
        </ul>
    </div>
    <div class="cg-1of4">
        <h3>Device Agnostic</h3>
        <ul>
            <li><p>We are designing a web product that can be used on numerous devices. Our products should be device agnostic and adapt to work on any device in our ecosystem.</p></li>
            <li><p>Design different interactions optimized for different input mechanisms (i.e. touch-tap vs mouse-click) not device type (i.e. phone vs desktop).</p></li>
        </ul>
    </div>
    <div class="cg-1of4">
        <h3>Directional</h3>
        <ul>
            <li><p>Everything in our products should be designed with a specific direction. We should be driving people towards specific goals with everything in the product.</p></li>
            <li><p>As a shopping experience, our core goal as a business is to drive conversions. From a practical perspective, this should be the primary direction which every person using our product should be heading.</p></li>
        </ul>
    </div>
    <div class="cg-1of4">
        <h3>Educating</h3>
        <ul>
            <li><p>Confusion abounds when people try to switch their energy suppliers. Providing the education people need when they need it is a core competency in which we should excel.</p></li>
            <li><p>Our products often need lots of explanation. Distilling every explanation into an easy-to-learn overview and a deeper, richer educational experience is important for converting confusion to confidence.</p></li>
        </ul>
    </div>
    <div class="cg-1of4">
        <h3>Modern</h3>
        <ul>
            <li><p>Energy choice is a very modern concept. We should be echoing this in our interfaces and forward-thinking products.</p></li>
            <li><p>Our products should evoke feelings of living in the future without relying on futuristic tropes. Use active and bleeding-edge design trends as inspiration.</p></li>
        </ul>
    </div>
    <div class="cg-1of4">
        <h3>Modular</h3>
        <ul>
            <li><p>Our product should aim to build small, modular blocks of content and interactions. We want the ability to mix and match modules throughout all of our products.</p></li>
            <li><p>When thinking about components we are designing and building, aim for the smallest meaningful atomic unit so that we may have the ability to reuse it somewhere else.</p></li>
        </ul>
    </div>
    <div class="cg-1of4">
        <h3>Simple</h3>
        <ul>
            <li><p>Our competitors use obfuscation as a weapon to keep customers beholden to them. We should be the exact opposite: empower people by clarifying things with plain, easy-to-understand language and imagery.</p></li>
            <li><p>Our user interfaces should parallel the easy-to-understand language of our site. Make it simple for anyone to use our products.</p></li>
        </ul>
    </div>
    <div class="cg-1of4">
        <h3>Trustworthy</h3>
        <ul>
            <li><p>Providing a unified, consistent experience from end-to-end is important for building trust with consumers who are dealing with multiple businesses (utility co., energy supplier, and energy marketplace) for every transaction.</p></li>
            <li><p>Engendering trust with social proof, data visualization, and trusted third-party content will be important in helping people through the switching process.</p></li>
        </ul>
