                </h2>
                <p>Last year, Choose Energy customers saved up to 37 percent on their energy bills by shopping around and switching suppliers. That’s because when suppliers compete for your business, you can shop smart by comparing rates. What’s more, we’ve negotiated special rates with our supplier partners that are available only through our site. So, let the savings begin.</p>

                <p> If it feels like your bill is changing personalities from one month to the next, then you might be game for what we call a fixed-rate plan. These plans let you lock in the rate you pay for the energy you use for a set period of time. Often, a fixed rate plan is a better deal than your utility’s variable-rate plan, which leaves you on the hook if there are large price spikes in the energy market. </p>

                <p> One out of every four Choose Energy customers selects a green energy plan, how cool is that? Going green doesn’t have to break the bank. In fact many of the green plans on our site are cost competitive with conventional plans. If you’re looking for electricity produced by renewable resources or, a natural gas plan paired with carbon offsets so you can reduce your carbon footprint, we have you covered. </p>
