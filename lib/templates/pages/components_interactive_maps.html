The Interactive Map Content Block is a NEXUS-specific Content Block. The Interactive Map displays some subset of NEXUS data on a d3.js Topojson Map using the Albers-USA projection system. The dataset to be displayed varies based on which map is selected.

The maps are available at two different resolutions:

- **USA**: Topojson Map containing one GeoJSON feature for each state. Data can be associated with each state.
- **State**: Topojson Map containing one GeoJSON feature for each region within a given state. Data can be associated with each region.

Once a map resolution is determined, there are a few pre-defined datasets that can be visualized upon the Interactive Map:

- Supplier Availability
    - Initial Highlight: Features where a supplier are active will be displayed with an initial highlight.
    - Hover Interaction: Interacting with a map feature will display what offerings a Supplier has in a given state/region.
    - Scoping: The dataset is scoped by Energy Type, Customer Type, and Supplier.
- Utility Availability
    - Initial Highlight: Features where a utility are active will be displayed with an initial highlight.
    - Hover Interaction: Interacting with a map feature will display the number of Suppliers/Plans available in a given state/region as well as some quick facts about the rates available for the given Utility.
    - Scoping: The dataset is scoped by Energy Type, Customer Type, and Utility.
- Energy Type Availability
    - Initial Highlight: Features where Choose Energy offers a given Energy Type will be displayed with an initial highlight.
    - Hover Interaction: Interacting with a map feature will display the number of Suppliers/Plans available for that Energy Type in a given state/region as well as some quick facts about the rates available for the given Energy Type.
    - Scoping: The dataset is scoped by Energy Type and Customer Type.

The only editable region in any Interactive Map Content Block should be the associated Headline and Introduction copy. The maps themselves are non-editable..</p>
