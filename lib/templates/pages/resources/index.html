<p class="callout-text">It doesn't end with just this pattern library - whether you're looking for brand assets to help with your design efforts or tools to assist with development, we have something helpful for you.</p>

<p>We also wanted to acknowlege all the other great pattern libraries with a diverse set of strengths that informed us while developing this site. We owe a debt to all the great teams who have shared their work with the public, allowing us to steal inpiration, suggestions, and sometimes code for our own efforts.</p>
