<h2 class="page-title">Pattern Library & Style Guide Examples</h2>

<p class="tertiary">This pattern library was inspired by many other pattern libraries and styleguides that are generously available to the public. While no one example met all our needs, there were many useful ideas, layouts, and processes that informed and will continue to inspire the development of this tool. The following example represent some of the most influential and interesting resources used when creating this site.</p>
