<h2 class="page-title">Code Guidelines</h2>

<p class="callout-text">With all the work we've put into creating a beautiful design, it's equally important to keep the code that implements it beautiful as well.</p>

<p>No one likes trying to make updates to disorganized, complex, hard to understand code - that's how we got ourselves in trouble in the first place! In order to make maintaining the UI code as painless as possible, we have documented the standards we used to create this version.</p> 

<p>Most of these guidelines will be second nature to experienced developers, but there are some coding guidelines that are specific to our needs, particularly around our SEO strategy. In general, these guide represent what we consider best practice at this point in time.</p>
