<h2 class="page-title">Patterns</h2>

<p class="callout-text">UI patterns are the fundamental building blocks of our design.</p>

<p>These element generally can't be broken down into smaller components without loosing their meaning and are primarily related to basic HTML elements. These include basic style for typography, our icons, individual elements (i.e. headers, paragraphs, buttons, etc.), and anything else that combines with other individual patterns to create reusable components or modules.</p>

<p>All of these basic patterns should be imported into all Choose Energy web projects to act as the foundation for any custom development. Overriding these basic style elements or creating alternative styles is <b>very strongly discouraged</b> as that dilutes the consistency of the brand style. In the case that a new pattern is necessary, it should be added to this section to maintain a single source of truth and ensure that is does not cause conflicts with the current codebase.</p>
