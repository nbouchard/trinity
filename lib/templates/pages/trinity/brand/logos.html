<h3 id="variations" class="section-title">Logo Variations</h3>

<h5 class="subsection-title">Stacked Logo</h5>
<p>Our primary logo is what we call “stacked.” The vast majority of applications will use the stacked logo.</p>

<h5 class="subsection-title">Horizontal Logo</h5>
<p>There may be some instances where the stacked logo just doesn’t fit. In those cases, please use the secondary, or “horizontal” logo.</p>

<h3 id="use" class="section-title">Logo Use</h3>

<h5 class="subsection-title">Spacing</h5>

<p>In order to help our logo stand out and be noticed, it needs some clear space all the way around. The minimum amount of clear space is defined by the height of the “C” in the logo. This minimum amount of clear space is needed for both the stacked and horizontal logo.</p>

<p>The minimum height for both logos is 30px.</p>

<h5 class="subsection-title">Alterations</h5>

<p>There may be situations where the original logo design does not work well, for example if against a colored background. In these cases, there are a set of allowed alterations that can be made to the logo to adapt it to the situation. These allowed alterations include:</p>

<ul>
    <li>Changing the font color to white</li>
    <li>Changing the bolt to grayscale</li>
    <li>Changing the text and bolt to solid black or white</li>
</ul>

<p>There are some alterations to the logo that are not allowed as they negatively impact the brand style. These include:</p>

<ul>
    <li>Reordering the elements in the logo</li>
    <li>Changing the colors of the logo (other than as mentioned above)</li>
    <li>Changing or redrawing any elements</li>
    <li>Substituting other fonts</li>
    <li>Using the name without the bolt.</li>
</ul>

<h5 class="subsection-title">Bolt</h5>

<p>Our bolt is our most ownable visual element and we need to treat it with care. In general, don’t use the bolt on its own. Unlike brands like Apple and Nike, we haven’t been around long enough for our symbol to have meaning on its own, apart from our name.</p>

<p>There are a few occasions when use of the bolt is OK. For instance, on the back of our business cards. In that case, the bolt is on its own, but it is also permanently tied to the front of the card (which has our logo). It would also be OK to use the bolt as a lapel pin, or on a staff T-shirt. The idea is that if you’re wearing the pin or the shirt, and someone asks about it, you can identify our company and what we do. It is not OK to use the bolt on its own when we can’t explain it or put it into the right context, like in an online ad.</p>
