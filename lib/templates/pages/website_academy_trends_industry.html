                        September is the third most expensive month for con-ed customers because they use 28% more electricity compared to an average month. Customers can take advantage of a forecasted 8% decrease in energy prices to offset their higher consumption.

                        Nearly 75% of New Yorkers select plans longer than 12 months, demonstrating local interest in fixed prices to avoid price volatility.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        New Yorkers prefer lower priced, long term plans, rather than paying a premium for green energy plans. And there are many great low rate, 12 month plans now offered on ChooseEnergy.com

                    <p>
                        Con-ed customers looking to avoid price volatility are coming to Choose Energy in high volumes to secure fixed rates, as rates  tend to actually peak for con-ed customers in the fall months.
