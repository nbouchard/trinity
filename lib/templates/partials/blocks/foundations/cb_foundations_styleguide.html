    <h2>CSS Style Guide</h2>

    <h3>Coding Style</h3>

    <h4>Spacing</h4>
    <ul>
        <li>Use soft-tabs with a four space indent (for readability and consistency across all of our codebases).</li>
        <li>Use a single space after <code>:</code> in property declarations.</li>
        <li>Use a single space before <code>{</code> in selector rule declarations.</li>
        <li>Every CSS selector rule should reside on its own line to improve commit diffs and tracking changes to our CSS.</li>
        <li>Use a single newline after every CSS <code>{ ... }</code> block within a given section.</li>
        <li>Use two newlines to separate a given CSS section from the next CSS section in a file. Each section should start with a comment describing the section's purpose.</li>
    </ul>

    <h4>Commenting</h4>
    <p>Document your styles with comments as often as possible following <a href="http://warpspire.com/kss/" target="_blank">KSS syntax</a>. Long-term, this KSS documentation will be used in the living styleguide so we don't have to manage the documentation separately from the code.</p>
    <p>For Styleguide reference definitions, we use the dot notation format of <code>Styleguide Section.Reference</code> (i.e. for the <code>button</code> element base styling, the reference definition would be <code>Styleguide Elements.Interactive.Buttons</code>).</p>
    <p>Use <code>//</code> for comment blocks (instead of <code>/* */</code>). Compass will automatically strip these out of production code.</p>

    <h4>Variables</h4>
    <p>All <code>$variable</code> names should be formatted as <code>$categoryName-subcategoryName-variantName</code> where <code>subcategoryName</code> is optional and all sections in a variable should be <code>camelCase</code>.</p>
    <p>We use a number of categories of variables and mixins in our styles. Each of these should reside in their category specific files located within the <code>/styles/base/foundations/</code> folder. Non-category specific <code>$variable</code> or <code>@mixin</code> values used in more than one file should be placed in the <code>styles/base/_base.scss</code> file. Any <code>$variable</code> or <code>mixin</code> used solely in one file should be included at the top of the relevant file.</p>

    <h5>Color</h5>
    <p>All color definitions (base and derivative) should reside in the global <code>_colors.scss</code> file. Derivatives of colors may be created using <a href="http://jackiebalzer.com/color" target="_blank">SASS color functions</a> and <a href="http://compass-style.org/reference/compass/helpers/colors/" target="_blank">Compass color helpers</a>, but this should be done with caution. When reusing a color for a component-specific purpose, the <code>$variable</code> should be defined at the top of the file in which the component-specific color is used.</p>
    <p>When creating a base color definition, you should use <code>hex</code> for opaque values and <code>rgba</code> for semi-transparent values.</p>
    <p>Avoid creating new color definitions if possible, as we want to limit the number of colors used throughout the site to increase consistency and provide structure around our brand identity. Refer to the <a href="brand.html">Brand documentation</a> for specifics around color usage.</p>

    <h5>Z-Index</h5>
    <p>Our Z-Index scale is defined in <code>_zindex.scss</code>, and it provides a total of nine indices spread across three categories: body, overlay, and underlay. Each of these categories has a specific purpose:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><code>body</code>: Provides mid-range z-index values used for the body of any current interface. The majority of the site is set to the <code>z-body-mid</code> value.</li>
        <li><code>overlay</code>: Provides high z-index values used to create the effect of being above a given interface. These are primarily used for popups, toasts, floating headers, and similar components.</li>
        <li><code>underlay</code>: Provides low z-index values used to create the effect of being beneath a given interface. These are primarily used for background components.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Stacking order is a uniquely odd thing. If you are running into issues, please read <a href="http://philipwalton.com/articles/what-no-one-told-you-about-z-index/" target="_blank">"What No One Told You About Z-Index"</a>, as it's a great overview of how stacking order works. Pay particular attention to the <a href="http://philipwalton.com/articles/what-no-one-told-you-about-z-index/#stacking-contexts" target="_blank">Stacking Contexts</a>. Ideally, we should create stacking contexts using <code>position</code> and <code>z-index</code> as opposed to using the opacity hack.</p>

    <h5>Typography</h5>
    <p>All typographical base definitions should reside in the global <code>_typography.scss</code> file. Most important in this section is the <code>typography()</code> mixin. This allows us to use any combination of our predefined typeface choices throughout the site without having to refactor changes to our typography in multiple places.</p>
    <p>The mixin provides four variants:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><code>headline</code>: This is used to style all of our <code>h*</code> elements with our headline typography choices. It is acceptable but not encouraged to style non-<code>h*</code> elements as headlines.</li>
        <li><code>subhead</code>: Subheaders, typically meant to be paired with Headlines, should be a <code>h*</code> element.</li>
        <li><code>accent</code>: Accents should be used judiciously for short non-interface copy. Examples include blockquotes, pull quotes, and callouts.</li>
        <li><code>body</code>: Everything is prestyled as body type, so this mixin keyword is typically only used to override other typeface styles.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>For more about our typography, please refer to <a href="brand.html">brand typography</a>, <a href="elements.html">typography in use</a>, and <a href="foundations.html#vertical-rhythm">vertical rhythm</a>.</p>

    <h5>Media Queries</h5>
    <p>We use <a href="http://breakpoint-sass.com/" target="_blank">breakpoint</a> to define media queries. Specific breakpoints should be defined in the <code>_mq.scss</code> file. This allows us to fine-tune media queries across the site all at once. If a component needs a specific media query breakpoint, define it at the top of the file in which the component-specific breakpoint is used.</p>


    <h4>Formatting</h4>

    <h5>Nesting</h5>
    <p>Avoid nesting deeper than three levels, as this can cause performance issues if we do it too often. If you find yourself needing nesting deeper than three levels, consider refactoring the styles into smaller components or simplifying the DOM structure.</p>
    <p>To learn more about writing efficiently nested CSS, Mozilla has <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Guide/CSS/Writing_efficient_CSS" target="_blank">a good guide on the subject</a>.</p>

    <h5>Quotes</h5>
    <p>While quotes are optional in CSS, we use double quotes to visually distinguish strings from variables, selectors, and properties.</p>

    <h5>Browser Prefixing</h5>
    <p>All browser prefixes for CSS3 properties should never be created manually. Instead, you should use the relevant <a href="http://compass-style.org/reference/compass/css3/" target="_blank">Compass Mixin</a>. If there is not a mixin for the browser prefixed property you wish to you, check out <a href="http://caniuse.com/" target="_blank">Can I Use</a> for the latest browser support matrix on the property and ensure you actually need browser prefixes.</p>

    <h3>File Organization</h3>
    <p>Our Styles folder for any given project should always have the same structure:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><code>/styles</code>
            <ul>
                <li><code>/base</code>
                    <ul>
                        <li><code>/components</code>
                            <ul>
                                <li><code>_component.scss</code></li>
                            </ul>
                        </li>
                        <li><code>/foundations</code>
                            <ul>
                                <li><code>_foundation.scss</code></li>
                            </ul>
                        </li>
                        <li><code>/plugins</code>
                            <ul>
                                <li><code>_plugin.scss</code></li>
                            </ul>
                        </li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
                <li><code>/project</code>
                    <ul>
                        <li><code>/components</code>
                            <ul>
                                <li><code>_component.scss</code></li>
                            </ul>
                        </li>
                        <li><code>/interfaces</code>
                            <ul>
                                <li><code>_interface.scss</code></li>
                            </ul>
                        </li>
                        <li><code>/plugins</code>
                            <ul>
                                <li><code>_plugin.scss</code></li>
                            </ul>
                        </li>
                    </ul>
                <li><code>_project.scss</code></li>
                <li><code>styles.scss</code></li>
            </ul>
        </li>
    </ul>
    <p>The only files that should exist outside of a folder in your <code>/styles</code> root are <code>_project.scss</code> files that act as manifests for a given project's SCSS. The value of "project" should always match a child folder in <code>/styles</code> (i.e. for the "Shopping App", the project identifier may be "shop" which results in a file <code>_shop.scss</code> in the root folder as well as a folder named <code>shop</code> with any shopping-specific components, interfaces, and plugins defined in their relevant folders.</p>
    <p>The <code>base</code> folder is a <a href="http://blogs.atlassian.com/2013/05/alternatives-to-git-submodule-git-subtree/" target="_blank">Git Subtree</a> that is shared across all Choose Energy projects. If you have not worked with Git Subtrees before, you should read <a href="https://medium.com/@v/git-subtrees-a-tutorial-6ff568381844" target="_blank">git subtree: a tutorial</a> before attempting to modify our base styles.</p>
    <p>It should be noted that no interface level styles should ever be defined within the base styles; if a specific interface is meant to be reusable across projects, it should be built as related components instead. Similarly, foundational styles should only be defined in our base styles. We should never be defining blanket overrides to foundational styles in projects. Any overrides to foundational styles should be scoped to the interface level.</p>

    <h3>Sizing</h3>
    <p>All sizing should be done using <code>em</code> values instead of <code>px</code> values to properly scale interfaces using zoom and accessibility features. Pixel values are acceptable for <code>border</code> values, <code>border-radius</code> values, and other <code>em</code>-fractional values that are not intended to scale without manual scaling.</p>

    <h3>Layout vs Style</h3>
    <p>Thing</p>

    <h3>Class Naming Patterns</h3>

    <h4>Utility Classes</h4>
    <p>The basic syntax is as follows: <code>x-&lt;utilityName&gt;</code>.</p>
    <p>The <code>utilityName</code> value must always be <code>camelCase</code> and prefixed with the <code>x-</code> namespace.</p>
    <p>Utility classes modify low-level structural and positional traits of elements, and their usage is most frequent when prototyping or designing in the browser. Utility classes may be applied directly to any element, though they may not always have an effect (i.e. <code>x-textLeft</code> will apply <code>text-align</code> to any element, but an <code>img</code> element would be unaffected by this utility class).</p>
    <blockquote>
        <textarea class="codeSample html">&lt;div class="x-clearfix"&gt;
  &lt;p class="x-textTruncate"&gt;Some Truncated Text&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;img class="x-pullLeft" src="images/left-floated-image.jpg" alt=""&gt;
  &lt;img class="x-pullRight" src="images/right-floated-image.jpg" alt=""&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;</textarea>
    </blockquote>
    <p>Every Utility Class is paired with a SCSS mixin that may be included in any element's property declarations to apply the utility. Using the utility mixin is the preferred method, but these Utility Classes exist specifically to allow a designer or developer the option to prototype using the utility classes without spending an egregious amount of time experimenting with different SCSS mixins.</p>
    <p>Utility Classes should be avoided for use in production unless the only styling an element will receive is via the utility class.</p>
    <p>It should be noted that a lot of companies espouse the <code>u-</code> namespace for their utility classes, but we use the <a href="http://microformats.org/wiki/microformats2-parsing" target="_blank">Microformats2 parsing specification</a> for specifying semantic microformats, which would have conflicts with the <code>u-</code> namespace.</p>

    <h4>JavaScript Classes</h4>
    <p>The basic syntax is as follows: <code>js-&lt;targetName&gt;</code>.</p>
    <p>The <code>targetName</code> value must always be <code>camelCase</code> and prefixed with the <code>js-</code> namespace.</p>
    <p>JavaScript-specific classes reduce the risk that changing the structure or theme of components will inadvertently affect any required JavaScript behaviour and complex functionality. It is not necessary to use them in every case, just think of them as a tool in your utility belt. If you are creating a class, which you don't intend to use for styling, but instead only as a selector in JavaScript, you should probably be adding the js- prefix. In practice this looks like this:</p>
    <blockquote>
        <textarea class="codeSample html">&lt;a href="/action" class="js-action"&gt;Action Link&lt;/a&gt;</textarea>
    </blockquote>
    <p><strong>JavaScript-specific classes should not, under any circumstances, be styled.</strong></p>

    <h4>Element Classes</h4>


    <h4>Component Classes</h4>
        <p>The basic syntax is as follows: <code>ce-&lt;{component-name}&gt;</code>.</p>
        <p>Component scope isolating tag. There is only 1 per component and everything else is nested inside.</p>
        <p>Html:</p>
<textarea class="code-sample html">&lt;div class="ce-stats"&gt; stats content &lt;/div&gt;</textarea> <br/>
        <p> CSS:</p>
<textarea class="code-sample html">
.ce-stats {
    width: $site-max-width;
    background: $color-green-shamrock;
}
</textarea>
    <h4>Component Varient Classes</h4>
        <p>The basic syntax is as follows: <code>v-&lt;{varient-name}&gt;</code>.</p>
        <p>Used hand in hand with component classes to account for variants in the look of a component.</p>
        <p>Html:</p>
<textarea class="code-sample html">&lt;div class="ce-stats v-fullwidth"&gt; stats content &lt;/div&gt;</textarea> <br/>
        <p> CSS:</p>
<textarea class="code-sample html">
.ce-stats {
    width: $site-max-width;
    background: $color-green-shamrock;
    &.v-tall {
        height:60em;
    }
}
</textarea>
    <h4>Override Classes</h4>
        <p>The basic syntax is as follows: <code>o-&lt;{related component}&lt;{overriding identifier}&gt;</code>.</p>
        <p>These classes that allows for one off changes to ce- or m-. Should be extremely limited use. This doesn't live inside the related CE- style.</p>
        <p>Html:</p>
<textarea class="code-sample html">&lt;div class="ce-stats o-stats-press"&gt; stats content &lt;/div&gt;</textarea> <br/>
        <p> CSS:</p>
<textarea class="code-sample html">
.ce-stats {
    width: $site-max-width;
    background: $color-green-shamrock;
    &.v-tall {
        height:60em;
    }
}
.o-stats-press {
    background: $color-blue-curious;
}
</textarea>

    <h3>Layouts</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>Fundamentals</li>
        <li>Desktop</li>
        <li>Tablet</li>
        <li>Mobile</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>ChooseGrid System</h3>
    <p>We maintain our own grid system, as some of our requirements are unique compared to most of the framework-based grid systems. The primary goals of the Choose Grid System are as follows:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Lightweight</strong>: We don't need a grid system that immediately enables every potential grid layout that we might need. We know our needs and can optimize our grids for those needs.</li>
        <li><strong>Responsive</strong>: Nobody wants a layout that breaks when the browser gets resized. To combat this, we've predefined our breakpoints and set our grid system up with the ability to stack grid items when necessary.</li>
        <li><strong>Easy to use</strong>: Built to be easy to learn, easy to implement, ChooseGrid is very predictable with its defaults but can be configured for much more advanced usage.</li>
        <li><strong>Semantic</strong>: Many grid systems muck up the DOM with non-semantic class names that define layout styles in HTML, which is a practice we actively discourage. ChooseGrid helps keep separation of concerns by providing SCSS Mixins for every grid definition. When defining production-ready code, we can utilize the Mixins and ensure our DOM remains semantic and keeping class assignments to a minimum.</li>
        <li><strong>Flexible</strong>: While being lightweight, we still want the grid system to be flexible enough to produce a wide range of layouts without additional cost. To do this, we provide pre-defined layout classes to enable prototyping layout variants quickly. These pre-defined grid classes should be used only in prototyping and should never make it to production.</li>
        <li><strong>Cross-browser</strong>: Initially, we were experimenting with using <code>flexbox</code> grids for our apps, but testing proved out that the polyfills were still insufficient for providing a single experience across browsers we support. The current ChooseGrid implementation should function properly on all browsers we support.</li>
    </ul>

        <li>Grid Variations</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Vertical Rhythm</h3>
    <p>We maintain a <code>0.5em</code> vertical grid that defaults to an <code>8px</code> vertical rhythm.</p>
    <small>On ChooseUX, the <code class="html">&lt;div id="gridder"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</code> element can have the <code>display</code> property to <code>block</code> instead of <code>none</code> to show the vertical rhythm grid over the style guide.</small>

        </li>
        <li>Breakpoints</li>
        <li>Cards vs Tiles</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Accessibility</h3>
    <p>For us to reach the widest possible audience for our products, we need our products to be accessible to all people, regardless of limitations on their abilities. Any user should be able to navigate the product, understand it, and complete their goals. Accessibility is hard, and this is only an overview.</p>
    <p>Assistive technologies have enabled individuals with disabilities to use technology in new and innovative ways. When thinking about our products, we should always consider how individuals will be using them in the following ways:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Without sound</li>
        <li>Without color</li>
        <li>With the high contrast mode enabled</li>
        <li>With the screen magnified</li>
        <li>With a screen reader (no visible screen)</li>
        <li>With voice control only</li>
        <li>With a combination of the above</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Here are some general rules for designing and building highly accessible products to which we should strive to adhere:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Design and build spartan interfaces</strong>: Our products are all very task-oriented. Every user interface should have the least number of elements required to complete the task effectively. Do not add decorative elements without considering and measuring their impact on the user's ability to complete the task or tasks that they are looking to complete.</li>
        <li><strong>Do not strand your user</strong>: Consider the "back" and "reload" buttons in a web browser to be the nuclear option to navigation. Avoid leaving your user stuck in an interface with no way back, getting thrown to a view out of context, or not being given proper time to consider an alert or confirmation screen. For example, if a user adds a product to their cart and is taken to checkout, the checkout screen should have a way back to the previous shopping screen, they should be taken to the top of the checkout page, and it should be clear to the user why they are now at a checkout page.</li>
        <li><strong>Support non-standard control schemes</strong>: Some users do not use mice and rely heavily on keyboard navigation, some users rely on voice recognition and screen readers, and some users will be heavily reliant on touch interfaces. Ensure that <code>:hover</code> and <code>mouseover</code> events are able to be triggered by these users just like those using a mouse. Ensure that any action available via a keyboard shortcut is also available in the user interface.</li>
        <li><strong>Ensure touch targets are usable</strong>: Touch targets should be a minimum of 48x48 device pixels, and there should be at least 8 device pixels between any two touch targets. In most cases within our products, this equates to 3em square or larger touch targets with 0.5em margins around them.</li>
        <li><strong>Use semantic markup</strong>: Don't rely only on visual hierarchy to convey the information architecture of a given component or page. Utilize highly semantic markup that ties related information together at the DOM level so screen readers and individuals with styles disabled are able to understand the information on the page.</li>
        <li><strong>Support screen magnification</strong>: Visually impaired users may increase the default font size on their device or zoom in on content using scalar magnification. Ensure that their experience is not hindered by missing elements, broken or overlapping interface components, and that text properly scales across different platforms.</li>
        <li><strong>Support color-blind interfaces</strong>: When an interface relies heavily on color for the interpretation of the interface, add iconography or patterns to accompany colors to allow users with color-blindness to properly interpret the interfaces.</li>
