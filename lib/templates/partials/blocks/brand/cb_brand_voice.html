            <p>Choose Energy's voice is human and familiar, and our tone is conversational. Think of us as the well-informed friend or neighbor you always turn to for sound advice.</p>
            <p>We are:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Helpful but not salesy</li>
                <li>Friendly but not intrusive</li>
                <li>Casual but not lazy</li>
                <li>Authoritative but not pushy</li>
                <li>Confident but not cocky</li>
                <li>Smart but not stodgy</li>
                <li>Knowledgable but not jargony</li>

            <p>To borrow from the late great George Orwell:</p>
            <blockquote>
                <ul>
                    <li>Never use a long word where a short one will do.</li>
                    <li>If it is possible to cut a word out, always cut it out.</li>
                    <li>Never use the passive where you can use the active.</li>
                    <li>Never use a foreign phrase, a scientific word, or a jargon word if you can think of an everyday English equivalent.</li>
                    <li>Break any of these rules sooner than say anything outright barbarous.</li>
                </ul>

            <ul>
                <li>We heart the Oxford comma. Please use a comma after the penultimate item in a list of three or more items, before 'and' or 'or.'</li>
                <li>Please use bulleted or numbered lists whenever possible.</li>
                <li>Feel free to use contractions</li>
                <li>"To be" or not to be... please avoid "to be" verbs whenever possible, they can almost always be replaced by a more precise and active verb.
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>We would not say:</strong> Bill is going to start bringing all of his books to the group session for studying.</li>
                    <li><strong>We would say:</strong> Bill decided to bring all of his books to the group study session.</li>
                </ul>
                </li>
                <li>Sometimes a prepositional phrase is necessary. If you can find a way to cut out a prepositional phrase (to, of, from, about, in, on, etc.) do so.</li>
                <li>Avoid suspended sentences. Avoid subordinate clauses that break up the flow of the sentence. Those clauses should be placed at the beginning of the sentence if necessary.</li>
