                <li>Through our photography, we want to provide a human face and emphasize the human side of energy use to allow people to feel better connected to the unfamiliar experience of switching energy providers.</li>
                <li>Personalize the user experience as much as possible by using location-specific imagery</li>
                <li>Use modern, relatable imagery</li>
            </ul>

        <h2 class="content-editorial-subhead">Art Direction</h2>
        <div class="content-editorial-cta">
            <ul>
                <li>Photography should all be Landscape orientation, i.e. no Portrait or Square.</li>
                <li>Avoid use of fire of any type that is not natural gas, i.e. no logs, no fireplaces, no bonfires, fireworks, etc.</li>
                <li>Ensure every person in a photograph exudes positivity, i.e. smiling or laughing people.</li>
                <li>Unless the photos provide major location context, avoid people who are participating in activities unrelated to using some form of energy, i.e. people laying in the grass, sitting on a dock, or similar. Instead, focus on people who are participating in activities related to energy use, i.e. people cooking on a gas stove (ensure the burners are lit), people watching TV/movies, people using computers/technology, people spending time together indoors.</li>
                <li>Avoid grayscale photography.</li>
                <li>Use high-contrast, high dynamic range photography that will look good with white text sitting over it as often as possible, i.e. donâ€™t use a photo of a washed out pale yellow field or light blue sky with lots of white clouds.</li>
            </ul>
